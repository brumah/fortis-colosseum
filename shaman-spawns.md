-tile locations below are to ensure a shaman-seer-shaman ricochet  
-Make sure to turn on world location chunk line plugin. All solves below refer to chunk lines closest to shaman  
-solves assume you start on red tile. Any other tile will influence how shaman drags on spawn  
-Spawn location 1 and 4 are the only bad spawns (more optimization may be needed to remove any chance of bad spawns)

1. wait for shaman to drag to edge of chunk line and stand 1 tile south of chunk line (you will lose ticks so potentially send a tbow shot as shaman drags)
2. stand 1 tile south of chunk line
3. stand 1 tile south of chunk line
4. stand 1 tile west of chunk line (sometimes this setup doesn't work; i think it has to do with fremmy spawn location)
5. stand 1 tile north and 1 tile west of chunk lines
6. not sure if shaman can spawn here. I've never seen it in hundreds of runs
7. stand 1 tile east of chunk line
8. stand 1 tile west of chunk line
9. stand 1 tile east of chunk line
10. stand 1 tile south of chunk line and 2 tiles west of shaman  
11. stand 1 tile east of chunk line
