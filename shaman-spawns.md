-Make sure to turn on world location chunk line plugin. All solves below refer to chunk lines closest to shaman.

1. wait for shaman to drag to edge of chunk line and stand 1 tile south of chunk line (you will lose ticks so potentially send a tbow shot as shaman drags)
2. stand 1 tile south of chunk line
3. stand 1 tile south of chunk line
4. stand 1 tile west of chunk line (sometimes this setup doesn't work; i tihnk it has to do with fremmy spawn location)
5. stand 1 tile north and 1 tile west of chunk lines
6. stand 1 tile north of chunk lines
7. stand 1 tile east of chunk line
8. stand 1 tile west of chunk line
9. stand 1 tile east of chunk line
10. stand 1 tile south of chunk line and 2 tiles west of shaman to ensure ricochet off of seer
